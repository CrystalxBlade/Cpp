## 🧠 What is a structure in C++?

A structure (struct) is a user-defined data type that groups different types of variables under one name.

Structs can contain many different data types (string, int, double, bool, etc.)
variables in structures are known as "members" members can be accessed with 
"Class Member Access Operator". 

Think of it as making your own custom data type.
