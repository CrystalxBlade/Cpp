### 1. Reverse a number (e.g. 123 → 321)
### 2. Count the number of digits in a number
### 3. Print the factorial of a given number
### 4. Check if a number is a palindrome (same forward and backward)
### 5. Find the largest digit in a number
### 6. Print the Fibonacci series up to n terms
### 7. Check if a number is prime
### 8. Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100
### 9. Print all factors of a number
### 10. Find GCD (HCF) and LCM of two numbers
### 11. Find the power of a number (e.g. a^b) without using pow()
### 12. Check if a number is an Armstrong number (e.g. 153)
### 13. Find all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 1000
### 14. Check if a number is a strong number (sum of factorial of digits = number)
### 15. Print all prime numbers in a range using nested loops
### 16. Write a program to display the cube of numbers up to a given integer.
### 17. Write a program to display multiplication tables vertically from 1 to n.
### 18. Take a, n, d from user and print Arithmetic Progression (A.P).
### 19. Take a number and count:  -its length
                          -sum of odd and even digits
then use those two sums as first and second Fibonacci terms → print Fibonacci till n terms.

### 20. Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
### 21. Implement prime factorization of a number (print prime factors with exponents).
